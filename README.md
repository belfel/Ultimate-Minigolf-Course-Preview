# Ultimate Minigolf Course

This is a preview of a Unity game project of mine.
UMC is a Steam only, online only minigolf game for 2-4 players.
Unlike other minigolf games the score is not based on number of strokes. Instead, the points are awarded to players who manage to reach the goal, but only if at least one other player didn't make it in time.
After every round each player will get to pick and place an object as shown in the video below.

Player's goal is to try and modify the course in a way in which he's the only one who can complete the course (reach the goal).
